# Random_Password_Generator

## DESCRIPTION

The random password generator exercise is a JavaScript application that is designed to build random passwords based on the users preference. The user can generate a random password using different characters such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

## HOW TO

When the user is on the website, the user will have to go through a series of prompts.

Step by Step:

-Click "Generate Password"
-Prompt will ask "How many characters you password would like to be?
(minimum of 8 characters, max of 128)
-Would you likr lowercase?
-Uppercase?
-Numbers?
-Symbols?
 At the end the generator would have given the user a random password according to their preference.

 ## HOW IS THIS USEFUL?

 JavaScript is a powerful tool to help users on the web. This exercise only shows the basic principles of the language. 

 ## WHAT I LEARNED

 I am still trying to understand the basic process that goes into writing code. My problem is that I don't have a plan when I go into these assignments (yet). I just try to go and figure it out. This assignment showed me that I need to remember the tools I have and think of a clear and logical way to approach these assignments.

 Pseudocoding is also very helpful. I am still getting used to commenting on my own work and trying to comment often. Often times I forget what I did and can't remember where I left off at which can hinder my timing and performance.

 ## SHOUTOUTS

 This project would not have been done if it were not for office hours, discord study rooms with my cohort, and google.
